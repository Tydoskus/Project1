[DONE] Implementation of the CookieList Class	(Ryan)

These are the functions we need to implement in the CookieList class:

[DONE] Default constructor (Lily)

[DONE] Function addCookie (Jordan)

[DONE] Function addCookie (overloaded) (Maha)

[DONE] Function getCount (Ryan)

[DONE] Function isEmpty (Lily)

[DONE] Function searchCookie (Jordan)

[DONE] Function printAllCookies (Maha)

[DONE] Function clearList (Ryan)

[DONE] Destructor (Lily)

Copy constructor (Jordan)
	Parameter: an object of the CookieList class.
	Using the member function addCookie() that passes a Cookie object, copy each Cookie object from the parameter list into the calling list. Do NOT forget that this is a constructor. What does this mean? It means that you need to initialize the member variables before you can start copying.

[DONE] Overloaded assignment operator (Maha)
